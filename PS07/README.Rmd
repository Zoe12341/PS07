## GitHub Documents

This is an R Markdown format used for publishing markdown documents to GitHub. When you click the **Knit** button all R code chunks are run and a markdown file (.md) suitable for publishing to GitHub is generated.

## Use the following packages:

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

## Including Plots

### A graph a women's height and weight

* Trends in this graph
  + there is a positive correlation between height and weight
  
*note that correlation doesn't mean causation*

```{r}
ggplot(datasets::women, aes(x = height, y = weight)) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Women's height and weight", y = "weight (in lbs)", x = "height (in)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
